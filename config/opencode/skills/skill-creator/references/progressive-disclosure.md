# Progressive Disclosure

Token-efficient skill design through staged information loading.

## Three-Tier Loading Model

```
Tier 1: Metadata (~100 tokens)
├── name + description
├── Loaded at agent startup for ALL skills
└── Used to decide: "Is this skill relevant?"

Tier 2: SKILL.md Body (<2000 tokens)
├── Full instructions
├── Loaded when skill is triggered
└── Contains navigation to Tier 3

Tier 3: Bundled Resources (on-demand)
├── references/, scripts/, assets/
├── Loaded only when explicitly needed
└── No token cost until accessed
```

## Context Window Economics

| Scenario | Files Loaded | ~Tokens |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Agent startup (10 skills) | Metadata only | ~1000 |
| Skill triggered | + SKILL.md | +1500 |
| Read 1 reference | + reference file | +800 |
| Full implementation | SKILL.md + 2-3 refs | ~4000 |
| **Worst case** | Everything | 10000+ |

**Key insight:** Proper navigation keeps budget at 2-5K. Poor navigation explodes to 10K+.

## File Decomposition Strategy

### Single-File vs Multi-File Decision

```
Keep in single SKILL.md when:
├─ Total content < 200 lines
├─ All content needed together
└─ No distinct "optional" sections

Split into multiple files when:
├─ Content > 200 lines
├─ Different tasks need different content
├─ Sections are mutually exclusive
└─ Large reference tables/schemas
```

### The 5-File Pattern

For complex products/domains:

```
product/
├── README.md           # Overview, quick start (always read first)
├── api.md              # Runtime APIs, types
├── configuration.md    # Setup, config files
├── patterns.md         # Best practices, examples
└── gotchas.md          # Pitfalls, debugging
```

**Task-based loading:**

| Task | Files to Read |
|------|---------------|
| Quick start | README.md only |
| Implement feature | README + api + patterns |
| Configure/setup | README + configuration |
| Debug issue | gotchas.md |

**Token savings:** 2-3K per task vs 5-6K reading everything.

## Cross-Referencing

### Do: Link Without Duplicating

```markdown
## Quick Start

Basic usage here...

## Advanced Features

**Form filling**: See [forms.md](./references/forms.md)
**Batch processing**: See [batch.md](./references/batch.md)
```

Agent loads forms.md or batch.md only when needed.

### Don't: Duplicate Content

```markdown
## Quick Start
Here's how to process PDFs...

## Advanced Features
As mentioned above, to process PDFs...  # BAD: duplicates content
```

## Navigation Patterns

### "In This Reference" Section

Always include in SKILL.md:

```markdown
## In This Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [api.md](./references/api.md) | Runtime APIs |
| [config.md](./references/config.md) | Setup |
| [patterns.md](./references/patterns.md) | Best practices |
| [gotchas.md](./references/gotchas.md) | Troubleshooting |
```

### "Reading Order" Section

Guide task-based navigation:

```markdown
## Reading Order

| Task | Files |
|------|-------|
| New project | README + config |
| Add feature | README + api + patterns |
| Debug | gotchas |
```

### Decision Trees for Routing

For large skills:

```
What do you need?
├─ Store data → See storage/
│   ├─ Key-value → kv/
│   ├─ SQL → d1/
│   └─ Objects → r2/
├─ Run code → See compute/
│   ├─ Serverless → workers/
│   └─ Stateful → durable-objects/
```

Agent routes to correct product without reading everything.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Monolithic SKILL.md | Context rot | Split by task/domain |
| Duplicated content | Staleness, bloat | Link, don't copy |
| Missing navigation | Agent guesses | Add decision trees |
| Everything in Tier 2 | Wasted tokens | Push details to Tier 3 |
